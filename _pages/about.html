<p>I'm a software developer at Hudson River Trading. Before that, I majored in Computer Science at National University of Singapore, where I got the change to do a bunch of <a href="https://praveer922.github.io/experience/">different things</a>.</p>
<p>I'm interested in <a href="https://praveer922.github.io/computer-graphics/">Computer Graphics</a>, and sometimes spend my free time <a href="https://github.com/praveer922/">building things</a>.
<p>I also love watching and <a href="https://praveer922.github.io/filmmaking/">making films</a>.</p>
